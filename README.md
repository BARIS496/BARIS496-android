# ZoologicalFooding-android
We are developing the Zoological Food project that we developed as a group for Bil 496 course. In this project, we plan to follow up the food containers we have placed for street animals in various environments. We aim to keep track of which containers are removable and where the animals need food through a mobile application and a website. In this case, we are not only for the people working in this project, but also for everyone.
